# String Calculator TDD Kata

## Overview
The String Calculator is a simple Java application that adds numbers provided in a string format. It demonstrates the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by using unit tests to drive the implementation of the functionality. 

## Features
- Supports an empty string input (returns `0`).
- Can handle single numbers and multiple numbers (comma- or newline-separated).

- Throws an exception for negative numbers, providing a detailed message listing all negative numbers encountered.
